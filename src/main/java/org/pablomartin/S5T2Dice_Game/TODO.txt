1) Principal of the Authentication generated from an Access JWT must contain enough data
to provide info for:
    identify unequivocally the client authenticated.
    id of the client (for authorization when {id} in paths).

2) Principal of the Authentication generated from Refresh JWT must contain enough data
to provide info for:
    identify unequivocally the refresh token.
    identify unequivocally the authenticated client.
    Opcional (makes the logic easier): generate new access JWT
        *Maybe for generate new access JWT the info can be loaded from current Authentication
        (calling the SecurityContext)

3) Granted Authorities of the Authentication from an Access JWT must contain, at least, :
    the role of the client.

4) Access / refresh JWT. Store only information that it's not a problem if are seen by "third parties".
