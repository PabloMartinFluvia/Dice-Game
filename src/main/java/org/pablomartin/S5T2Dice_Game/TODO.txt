4) Access / refresh JWT. Store only information that it's not a problem if are seen by "third parties".
        Refresh JWT:
            refresh token id
            owner id
        Access JWT:
            owner id
            username (if registered or admin)
            role (if annonimous)


1) Principal of the Authentication generated from an Access JWT must:

be an instance that implements TokenPrincipal. //TODO

contain enough data to provide info for:
    id of the client (for authorization when {id} in paths).

2) Principal of the Authentication generated from Refresh JWT must:

be an instance that implements RefreshTokenPrincipal. //TODO

contain enough data to provide info for:
    identify unequivocally the authenticated client (inherited from TokenDetails)
    identify unequivocally the refresh token.
    Opcional (makes the logic easier): provide info for populate owner's claims
        when creating an access JWT

3) Granted Authorities of the Authentication from JWT must contain for authorizations, at least, :
    Access:
        the role of the client.
    Refresh:
        none required, due there's no authorizations filters when authentication with a
        Refresh JWT.




5) Principal of the Authentication generated from Basic Auth must be able to provide playerOld's ID.
